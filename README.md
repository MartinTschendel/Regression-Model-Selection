# Regression-Model-Selection
Use the metrics 'root mean squared error (rmse)' and 'r squared (r2)' to measure the performance of differen regression models:
* Decision Tree Regression (rmse: 0.182; r2: 0.972)
* Multiple Linear Regression (rmse: 0.619; r2: 0.672)
* Polynomial Regression (rmse: 0.287; r2: 0.93). I had to adjust the selection of categorical features in the polynomial regression model. If I would have used the feature 'make' like in the decision tree and multiple linear regression models, I would get a memory error.
* Random Forest Regression 
* Support Vector Regression
